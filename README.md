# App:ointment  

This is a homecare appointment application for **clients** and **caregivers** to manage appointments and specify the form of care.  

Basic MVP implementation with **MVC architecture** and **database migration**.

## Node.js Version  
The Node.js version used for this project is **22.18.0**.

## Login System  
We have implemented a **login window on the Home page**, where the user can choose which role to log in as:  
- **Admin**  
- **Caregiver**  
- **Client**  

This allows for role-based navigation and functionality depending on the selected user type.  

## Note  
We have attempted to implement a working login system with username and password (authentication and authorization), but this feature is not yet fully functional and will be completed before the final report.
